# zombiegbt
A top down rogue zombie shooter game made using Chatgbt and HTML5 in a single file.

This is my first game and I have no coding experience. 
**I would like to invite you to explore, modify, and enhance it with your creative ideas!
**

**To install:**
Simply download the file zombieGBT.html and run it in your favorite browser!

I know it looks like 1980 graphics but try it out :)
