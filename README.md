# zombiegbt
A top down rogue zombie shooter game made using Chatgbt and HTML5 in a single file.

This is my first game and I have no coding experience. 

**I would like to invite you to explore, modify, and enhance it with your creative ideas!**

Features:
- Zombies and Elite Zombies
- Guns: Pistol - Machine Gun - Laser - Shotgun - Flamethrower - Crossbow
- Quick reload (pistol)
- Headshots and Crawling zombie effect
- Shop for upgrades and momey system
- Pick up items and powers (speed, slow motion, guns, shield)
- Test mode and God mode

Work in progress:
- Making it more playable! lol
- Adding new fun weapons (not that easy but a main objective!)
- Better sound effects, hopefully
- Balancing


**To install:**
Simply download the file zombieGBT.html and run it in your favorite browser!

I know it looks like 1980 graphics but try it out :)
